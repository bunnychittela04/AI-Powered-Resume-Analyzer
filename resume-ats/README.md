AI-Powered Resume Analyzer (ATS Optimizer)

A web application that analyzes resumes against job descriptions (similar to an Applicant Tracking System).
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and TF-IDF to extract skills, match them against the job description, and calculate a match score with suggestions to improve.

ðŸš€ Features

ATS-style Match Score â€” Percentage showing how closely a resume matches a job description.

Resume Skills Extraction â€” Detects relevant technical & soft skills from the uploaded resume.

JD Keywords Extraction â€” Extracts important keywords from the provided job description.

Missing Keywords Suggestions â€” Highlights terms from the JD missing in the resume.

Semantic Similarity Analysis â€” Uses NLP & TF-IDF to compare text meaning, not just exact matches.

ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack

Backend: Python, Flask

NLP Libraries: spaCy, scikit-learn (TF-IDF)

File Parsing: PyPDF2, docx2txt

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Deployment (optional): Heroku / Render
